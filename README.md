## üö® Maintenance of this project has been stopped

The `YukiReflection` project has been deprecated due to many unsolved black box issues, so we no longer recommend anyone to use it.
Please now migrate to the brand new design [KavaRef](https://github.com/HighCapable/KavaRef).

## What's this

This is a concise and efficient Reflection API rebuilt based on Java's native Reflection API using Kotlin,
and it is also the core function being used by [YukiHookAPI](https://github.com/HighCapable/YukiHookAPI).

The name is taken from ["„ÇÇ„ÇÇ„Åè„Çä" heroine Yuki Kurihara](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ss5016).
